# This is an Ansible inventory file. It inherits from /etc/ansible/hosts if it exists
# It organises hosts/nodes into logical groups which can then be used in playbooks

# This inventory is for the 'development' environment

# It is best practice is group hosts by location and purpose like so:

[bslweb-vagrant]
bslweb-laravel-json-exception-formatter-dev-node1

[nodes:children]
bslweb-vagrant

[all-servers:children]
nodes
